I am a big fan of Immudelki's Code Lyoko Fangame, IFSCL.
but sometimes i need fresh ideas to keep Custom Games Interesting.
After i saw someone on the Discord had Made a Custom EXAPUNKS puzzle
for an RNG, i decided to try my hand at writing my own. the premise will be that
you create an EXA which travels through a network grid. Then there will be a file on each network
for each Custom game option in IFSCL. when the Exa gets to the network, you pick a file and copy the data to a second EXA holding an empty file.
this continues until all blocks of the grid have been visited and a file chosen from each one. Afterwards, you just read what you chose from the new file and there's your custom Game!
